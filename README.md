do not work for this purpose.

AdafritÂ´s library: 
  This is a library for the BME280 humidity, temperature & pressure sensor
  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit BME280 Breakout
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/2650
  These sensors use I2C or SPI to communicate, 2 or 4 pins are required
  to interface. The device's I2C address is either 0x76 or 0x77.
